## Neural Network on Steroids!
Implementation of a Neural network take 2 inputs:

1. an image from the MNIST dataset (say 5), and
2. a random number between 0 and 9, (say 7)

and gives two outputs:
1. the "number" that was represented by the MNIST image (predict 5), and
2. the "sum" of this number with the random number and the input image to the network (predict 5 + 7 = 12)
